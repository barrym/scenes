h3. TODO:

# Remove .play method. Scene['foo'] should auto play, the same as Character['bar'] does.

# Add rake scenes
    Searches for all *_scene.rb in config/scenes ?

# Character['foo'].duplicate_as("bar").with do |bar|
    bar.name = "Bob"
  end

# Possibly add ability to pass options to character 

# Make init.rb create the scenes/ directory
