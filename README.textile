h1. Scenes

Scenes is a Rails plugin to set up system scenes, mainly for use with "Cucumber":https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree, but can also be used to set your system into a preset state. Initially this was developed to allow us to set up complex scenarios for our Cucumber stories.

h3. Characters

Characters are used to represent objects in the database. 

h4. Setup

Any method of initially creating an object can be used, as long as the created object is returned.

<pre>
<code>
  Scenes::Character.named("Alice) {
    User.create(:name => 'Alice', :age => 21)
  }
</code>
</pre>


Referencing a character is done as follows

<pre>
<code>
  Scenes::Character['Alice']
</code>
</pre>

The first time a character is referenced, it is created in the database, all times after that the object is retreived from the database.

h4. Changing default values

You can load in a character and change the default values by passing a block to the .with method

<pre>
<code>
  Scenes::Character['Alice'].with do |alice|
    alice.age = 25
  end
</code>
</pre>
