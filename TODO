* Remove .play method. Scene['foo'] should auto play, the same as Character['bar'] does.

* Add duplicate method

    Character['foo'].duplicate_as("bar").with do |bar|
      bar.name = "Bob"
    end

* Possibly add ability to pass options to character 

* Make init.rb create the scenes/ directory ?

* Make search results rake scenes display as the initial one does

* Make scene saving check if file already exists
